# Project Title

This is a C++ Tic Tac Game that can be played with an easy or hard AI and with another local player.
The AI algorithm uses random geenration (easy) and a min-max algortihm (hard) to make decisions.

### Min-Max Alogrithm

A simple way to look at a min-max alogrithm is, per turn, the algorithm with travel down all the possible paths given the state of the board, with outcomes assigned with score (win, loss and tie).
The AI will analyze the board as a maximizing player -- attaining the highest score -- and as the minimizing player (the human) -- attaining the lowest score. The AI will then choose moves that lead
to the desired outcome
